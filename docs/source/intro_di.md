If you ask [ChatGPT 4o](https://chatgpt.com/) a relatively simple question:

> in python, how can I configure a set of values, objects,
and their dependencies, and then lazily instantiate only the objects I want?

It may answer that you should use DI:

> To configure a set of values, objects, and their dependencies in Python
while allowing for lazy instantiation, you can use a dependency injection
approach combined with a factory pattern.
This setup avoids creating objects until they're explicitly needed.
